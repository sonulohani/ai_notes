# Machine learning notes

While I am learning ML, I thought it would be helpful to others also to go through the topics which I have already been through. Instead of searching in google for the entire topics, you can find the important links and content here. The contents are mainly taken from different websites and added here so that there is no need to search out the content again and again for revision. Even though I gave the references link however if missed I apologize. Please let me know if I need to put references anywhere and I am happy to do that. 

Happy Reading!!! :-)
